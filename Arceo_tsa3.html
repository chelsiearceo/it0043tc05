        BARBIE WORLD <span class="span">WILL BE CLOSED!</span>
    </h2>

    <p>
        It is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Barbie World, effective this coming Sunday, May 19, 2024. After
        several years of serving our community, we have made the difficult decision to close our doors. We want to
        express our deepest gratitude to all of our loyal customers who have supported us throughout the years.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a token of appreciation, we will be offering a clearance sale starting tomorrow, with discounts on all
        remaining inventory. This is your last chance to grab your favorite Barbie dolls, accessories, and merchandise
        before we bid farewell. We hope to see you one last time as we say goodbye to Barbie World.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sincerely,<br>
            Barbie World Management
        </br>
