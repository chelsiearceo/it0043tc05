            <p class="desc">Red (full name Red J. Bird according to The Angry Birds Movie 2, and originally George in
                the earlier concepts for the original game) is the mascot of the Angry Birds franchise. He's the leader
                of the titular Angry Birds flock, and the most dedicated to the cause of protecting the eggs, as well as
                the angriest bird of them all. Although his status and over-protective father-like personality may cause
                one to assume he is an adult, Red is actually one of the younger members of the flock, who stepped up to
                the role as leader as no one else was better suited for it.</p>

            <p class="desc">Artist Pig is a very sweet and ambitious artist, but is often discouraged by Gale when she
                yells at him for his low quality art. He feels dejected whenever Gale mistreats him and damages his
                self-esteem. However, after meeting Willow, she inspires him to improve his art by essentially mentoring
                him. He quickly catches on, and uses his newfound artistic knowledge to the best of his ability.</p>

            <p class="desc">Chuck is notable for his incredible speed. Having been called "the fastest bird in the
                world", he can use his speed to perform incredible tricks, such as stopping time, boosting in the
                air, and producing shock waves that can pop nearby balloons. In addition, he is so quick that, to the
                naked eye, it looks like he is teleporting whenever he is running. He is also capable of dodging and
                reacting to lightning.[note 3] While his top speed is unknown, he has managed to go from the Cobalt
                Plateaus to Pig City and retrieve the eggs when they were about to be put on a hot cauldron and return
                to the plateaus with them, all of it within seconds. Chuck also has sharp reflexes that let him
                react quickly to almost anything.</p>

            <p class="desc">The Corporal Pigs were originally Minion Pigs that King Pig arbitrarily chose to lead the
                kingdom's army. Seeing themselves as the "chosen ones", they see the king as a deity and carry out his
                orders without question, punishing any citizens for mocking him by deporting them off Piggy Island. The
                Corporal Pigs take their duty very seriously and relentlessly lead the Minion Pigs to battle. However,
                they are also lousy commanders, having lost all of their battles to the Angry Birds and refusing to
                learn from past mistakes, instead preferring to work out and shouting orders all day to appear more
                intimidating to the Minions.</p>

            <p class="desc">Dahlia's crest consists of nothing more than two large feathers, which she sometimes uses to
                dance in the Angry Birds Stella animated series and in idle animations of the game. She has brown
                plumage that becomes paler around her eyes, and white at her belly. She is of a tough, stocky build with
                three black tail feathers. She has dark orange pupils, two thick eyebrows that float above her face, one
                thick eyelash on each eye, and a curved yellow beak that is very short, typical for her species. In the
                animated series, she has three dark brown spots that can only be seen from behind.</p>
